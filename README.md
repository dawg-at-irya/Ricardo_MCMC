## Running the Zeus Code

To successfully run the Zeus code, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Data Directory**:
   - The data required to run the Zeus code is located in the `dat` folder within the repository.
   - You may need to adjust the location of this folder depending on where you plan to run the code. For example, if you are using Google Colab or another cloud-based environment, ensure that the path is correctly set to where the data resides in that environment.

2. **Modify the `dpath` Variable**:
   - In the main code file, locate the variable named `dpath`.
   - Update the `dpath` variable to point to the data directory. This is crucial for the code to correctly access the data files needed for execution.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the Zeus code runs smoothly on your system with the correct data path configurations.
